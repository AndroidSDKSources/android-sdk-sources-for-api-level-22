     * <p>Create a new camera capture session by providing the target output set of Surfaces to the

     *
     * <p>The active capture session determines the set of potential output Surfaces for

     *
     * <p>Surfaces suitable for inclusion as a camera output can be created for
     * various use cases and targets:</p>
     *
     * <ul>
     *
     * <li>For drawing to a {@link android.view.SurfaceView SurfaceView}: Once the SurfaceView's
     *   Surface is {@link android.view.SurfaceHolder.Callback#surfaceCreated created}, set the size
     *   of the Surface with {@link android.view.SurfaceHolder#setFixedSize} to be one of the sizes
     *   returned by {@link StreamConfigurationMap#getOutputSizes(Class)
     *   getOutputSizes(SurfaceHolder.class)} and then obtain the Surface by calling {@link
     *   android.view.SurfaceHolder#getSurface}. If the size is not set by the application, it will
     *   be rounded to the nearest supported size less than 1080p, by the camera device.</li>
     *
     * <li>For accessing through an OpenGL texture via a {@link android.graphics.SurfaceTexture
     *   SurfaceTexture}: Set the size of the SurfaceTexture with {@link
     *   android.graphics.SurfaceTexture#setDefaultBufferSize} to be one of the sizes returned by
     *   {@link StreamConfigurationMap#getOutputSizes(Class) getOutputSizes(SurfaceTexture.class)}
     *   before creating a Surface from the SurfaceTexture with {@link Surface#Surface}. If the size
     *   is not set by the application, it will be set to be the smallest supported size less than
     *   1080p, by the camera device.</li>
     *
     * <li>For recording with {@link android.media.MediaCodec}: Call
     *   {@link android.media.MediaCodec#createInputSurface} after configuring
     *   the media codec to use one of the sizes returned by
     *   {@link StreamConfigurationMap#getOutputSizes(Class) getOutputSizes(MediaCodec.class)}
     *   </li>
     *
     * <li>For recording with {@link android.media.MediaRecorder}: Call
     *   {@link android.media.MediaRecorder#getSurface} after configuring the media recorder to use
     *   one of the sizes returned by
     *   {@link StreamConfigurationMap#getOutputSizes(Class) getOutputSizes(MediaRecorder.class)},
     *   or configuring it to use one of the supported
     *   {@link android.media.CamcorderProfile CamcorderProfiles}.</li>
     *
     * <li>For efficient YUV processing with {@link android.renderscript}:
     *   Create a RenderScript
     *   {@link android.renderscript.Allocation Allocation} with a supported YUV
     *   type, the IO_INPUT flag, and one of the sizes returned by
     *   {@link StreamConfigurationMap#getOutputSizes(Class) getOutputSizes(Allocation.class)},
     *   Then obtain the Surface with
     *   {@link android.renderscript.Allocation#getSurface}.</li>
     *
     * <li>For access to raw, uncompressed JPEG data in the application: Create an
     *   {@link android.media.ImageReader} object with one of the supported output formats given by
     *   {@link StreamConfigurationMap#getOutputFormats()}, setting its size to one of the
     *   corresponding supported sizes by passing the chosen output format into
     *   {@link StreamConfigurationMap#getOutputSizes(int)}. Then obtain a
     *   {@link android.view.Surface} from it with {@link android.media.ImageReader#getSurface()}.
     *   If the ImageReader size is not set to a supported size, it will be rounded to a supported
     *   size less than 1080p by the camera device.
     *   </li>
     *
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>The camera device will query each Surface's size and formats upon this
     * call, so they must be set to a valid setting at this time.</p>
     *
     * <p>It can take several hundred milliseconds for the session's configuration to complete,
     * since camera hardware may need to be powered on or reconfigured. Once the configuration is
     * complete and the session is ready to actually capture data, the provided
     * {@link CameraCaptureSession.StateCallback}'s
     * {@link CameraCaptureSession.StateCallback#onConfigured} callback will be called.</p>
     *
     * <p>If a prior CameraCaptureSession already exists when a new one is created, the previous
     * session is closed. Any in-progress capture requests made on the prior session will be
     * completed before the new session is configured and is able to start capturing its own
     * requests. To minimize the transition time, the {@link CameraCaptureSession#abortCaptures}
     * call can be used to discard the remaining requests for the prior capture session before a new
     * one is created. Note that once the new session is created, the old one can no longer have its
     * captures aborted.</p>
     *
     * <p>Using larger resolution outputs, or more outputs, can result in slower
     * output rate from the device.</p>
     *
     * <p>Configuring a session with an empty or null list will close the current session, if
     * any. This can be used to release the current session's target surfaces for another use.</p>
     *
     * <p>While any of the sizes from {@link StreamConfigurationMap#getOutputSizes} can be used when
     * a single output stream is configured, a given camera device may not be able to support all
     * combination of sizes, formats, and targets when multiple outputs are configured at once.  The
     * tables below list the maximum guaranteed resolutions for combinations of streams and targets,
     * given the capabilities of the camera device.</p>
     *
     * <p>If an application tries to create a session using a set of targets that exceed the limits
     * described in the below tables, one of three possibilities may occur. First, the session may
     * be successfully created and work normally. Second, the session may be successfully created,
     * but the camera device won't meet the frame rate guarantees as described in
     * {@link StreamConfigurationMap#getOutputMinFrameDuration}. Or third, if the output set
     * cannot be used at all, session creation will fail entirely, with
     * {@link CameraCaptureSession.StateListener#onConfigureFailed} being invoked.</p>
     *
     * <p>For the type column, {@code PRIV} refers to any target whose available sizes are found
     * using {@link StreamConfigurationMap#getOutputSizes(Class)} with no direct application-visible
     * format, {@code YUV} refers to a target Surface using the
     * {@link android.graphics.ImageFormat#YUV_420_888} format, {@code JPEG} refers to the
     * {@link android.graphics.ImageFormat#JPEG} format, and {@code RAW} refers to the
     * {@link android.graphics.ImageFormat#RAW_SENSOR} format.</p>
     *
     * <p>For the maximum size column, {@code PREVIEW} refers to the best size match to the
     * device's screen resolution, or to 1080p ({@code 1920x1080}), whichever is
     * smaller. {@code RECORD} refers to the camera device's maximum supported recording resolution,
     * as determined by {@link android.media.CamcorderProfile}. And {@code MAXIMUM} refers to the
     * camera device's maximum output resolution for that format or target from
     * {@link StreamConfigurationMap#getOutputSizes}.</p>
     *
     * <p>To use these tables, determine the number and the formats/targets of outputs needed, and
     * find the row(s) of the table with those targets. The sizes indicate the maximum set of sizes
     * that can be used; it is guaranteed that for those targets, the listed sizes and anything
     * smaller from the list given by {@link StreamConfigurationMap#getOutputSizes} can be
     * successfully used to create a session.  For example, if a row indicates that a 8 megapixel
     * (MP) YUV_420_888 output can be used together with a 2 MP {@code PRIV} output, then a session
     * can be created with targets {@code [8 MP YUV, 2 MP PRIV]} or targets {@code [2 MP YUV, 2 MP
     * PRIV]}; but a session with targets {@code [8 MP YUV, 4 MP PRIV]}, targets {@code [4 MP YUV, 4
     * MP PRIV]}, or targets {@code [8 MP PRIV, 2 MP YUV]} would not be guaranteed to work, unless
     * some other row of the table lists such a combination.</p>
